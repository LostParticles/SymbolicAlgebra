Symbolic Algebra [0.5]
----------------------
- Added the ability to multiplication of many coeffecients with different power terms
	2^(x+z)*3^(x+y) * 2^v == 2^(x+z+v)*3^(x+y)

- Added Ability to differentiate coeffecients with symbolic powers and variables with symbolic powers
	u^(x^2)|x  == 2*log(u)*x*u^(x^2)
	


Symbolic Algebra [0.4]
-----------------------
- Corrected when differentiating special function raised to power  like  sin(x)^2  result in 2*cos(x)*sin(x)


Symbolic Algebra [0.3]
-----------------------

- Console Application that parse the variables and give results for speed testing :)
- Adding SymbolicVariable.Parse()  function  which includes +,-,/,* and pipe operator '|' that resemeble the differentiation 

- library can now distinguish the function and its parameters (it makes any necessary calculation inside the parameters to clean the value)

I mean if you wrote  sin(x+x) result will be sin(2*x)

- Differentiation of special functions has been implemented 
  Triogonometric functions and Hyperbolic

  so that writing  sin(3*x^2)|x    produce   6*x*sin(3*x^2)

This is actually a nice marvelous release.

still missing
triogonometric of power of 2 and more  like  sin(x)^2|x 
also  differentiating of number raised to symbol   (4^x)|x
