Symbolic Algebra [0.86]
------------------------
- Converted the library into Portable Library (vs 2010 portable tools RC)
      Targetting (.NET for Store Apps, Silverlight 4 and higher, .NET framework 4 and higher).
- Removed IClonable and all casting from the Clone method
- Removed pointers to the library from silver algebra and added the reference to the library directly

Symbolic Algebra [0.85]
------------------------
- (Fixed) When parsing 4e-2 the parsing go wrong because it consider 4e a unit and -2 another unit 

Symbolic Algebra [0.84]
------------------------
- Executing the symbolic variable instance will ignore any extra parameters you feed into it.
- Right Associativity for power operation.
- Fixed when dividing zero over complex symbolic variable to return zero also.
- Fixed when dividing multi term over multie term (if the two are identical) then we produce 1
- Adding when multiplieng two terms that if one of them is zero then the result will be zero directly without any more hassle.
- Fixed multiplication error of multiterm with divided variable othern than one when multiplied by other number
- Adding when multiplieng two terms that if one of them is one the other will be returned automatically.
- Fixed an error when getting involved symbols in this expression "5*sin(x)^(4^x)*log(sin(x))*log(4)*4^x+5*sin(x)^(4^x-1)*cos(x)*4^x"



Symbolic Algebra [0.83]
------------------------
- Fixed differentiation when raising function to power of the same parameter
  i.e. (sin(x)^x)|x  


Symbolic Algebra [0.82]
------------------------
- now Sqrt(x)^2  present x
- also sqrt(x) * sqrt(x) present x
- lot of bug fixes like 3^u+4^y 

- Simplification when creating log(x) has been implemented
	log(1) = 0
	log(exp(x)) = x
	log(y/x) = log(y)-log(x)

- Logarithmic Differentiation  (and it took me a great deal of time :) :)


Symbolic Algebra [0.81]
-----------------------
- Fixed case sensitive error :)  all my programs are not case sensitive :)

Symbolic Algebra [0.8]
-----------------------
- Summing or subtracting two different denominators terms result in a correct operation.
	for this bug i had to make a big addition by introducing another property ExtraTerms
	ExtraTerms holds the terms with different denominators other than 1  (review DividedTerm property)
- Differentiating of numerator/denominator has been corrected  and is now acting right despite the output
      remember that symbolic algebra is greedy evaluator and it means it will not store values in that form (x+y)^3/(a+b)^2
	    this is by design because the symbolic calculations is needed for numerical calculations after this
		so the output calced is always as expanded as the library can.
		
- Added the ability to store functions in the context 
     f(x) := x^2+sin(x)
	 f(x)|x   will get the derivative
	 f(o)|o   also get the derivative.
- Also stored functions can be executed in its context.



Symbolic Algebra [0.72]
-----------------------
- Sqrt(x) differentiation added
- differentiation for { "asin", "asinh", "acos", "acosh", "atan", "atanh", "asec", "asech", "acsc", "acsch", "acot", "acoth" }  implemented
- parsing for { "Sec", "Csc", "Cot", "Sech", "Csch", "Coth" , "ACosh", "ASinh", "ATanh", "ASec", "ACsc", "ACot", "ASech", "ACsch", "ACoth"} added in CoMath class  
- fixed  0- 1/(1+x)  yielded to only -1   which is now fixed.


Symbolic Algebra [0.71]
-----------------------
- Fixed parameter extraction in expression sin(3*x) to return x not 3*x
- in parsing expression to native function
    all parameters of the generated function is ordered by name 
	{ 
	 this will lower the overhead of guessing what parameter before what
	 and also will speed the execution because of getting rid of dictionary or tuple[] paramter array sending.
	}

- log(x) in parsing function is choosed as one parameter from Math.Log(x)  // needs enhancment if we used log(x,y)
- fixed negative triogonometric functions so that sin(-x) = -sin(x)

								

Symbolic Algebra [0.7]
----------------------
- enhanced the parsing to native functions
- corrected errors regarding calling nested functions and discovery of the nested parameters.
- enhanced the silver light version and added graphing ability to show the function trends.
   Dynamic Data Display for Silverlight (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/groups/science/tools/d3/dynamicdatadisplay.htm)



Symbolic Algebra [0.6]
----------------------
- Solved some issues (lot ones)
- At last you can differentiate multiplied functions like (sin(x)*cos(x))|x == cos(x)^2-sin(x)^2  :) :) :)
- fixed the log differentiation  after knowing the rule:   d/dx ln(g(x))  = g'(x)/g
-  and for fixing the log I had to alter the divide operation and adjusting lot of calcs here and there 
		{specially when symbolic power reach coefficient mode only I transfer its value to the numerical power and make it null 
		   either in primary term and in fused symbols}

- Added a native parsing so we can parse the resulted expression into a method to be called. (still calling function inside expression is not supported)
   this way we can form the expressions by calculations and get a function delegeate to execute it inside our program.

   double Execute(params Tuple<string, double>[] parameters)  // should be very illustrative from its body :)

- merged the silverlight application inside the solution (and altered the .csproj to include the files without copying them).

- Features not implemented yet:
	a] asin, acos in differentiation implementation.
	b] Ability to define custom functions in context and differentiate it also
	c] Division is not complete

Symbolic Algebra [0.5]
----------------------
- Added the ability to multiplication of many coeffecients with different power terms
	2^(x+z)*3^(x+y) * 2^v == 2^(x+z+v)*3^(x+y)

- Added Ability to differentiate coeffecients with symbolic powers and variables with symbolic powers
	u^(x^2)|x  == 2*log(u)*x*u^(x^2)
	


Symbolic Algebra [0.4]
-----------------------
- Corrected when differentiating special function raised to power  like  sin(x)^2  result in 2*cos(x)*sin(x)


Symbolic Algebra [0.3]
-----------------------

- Console Application that parse the variables and give results for speed testing :)
- Adding SymbolicVariable.Parse()  function  which includes +,-,/,* and pipe operator '|' that resemeble the differentiation 

- library can now distinguish the function and its parameters (it makes any necessary calculation inside the parameters to clean the value)

I mean if you wrote  sin(x+x) result will be sin(2*x)

- Differentiation of special functions has been implemented 
  Triogonometric functions and Hyperbolic

  so that writing  sin(3*x^2)|x    produce   6*x*sin(3*x^2)

This is actually a nice marvelous release.

still missing
triogonometric of power of 2 and more  like  sin(x)^2|x 
also  differentiating of number raised to symbol   (4^x)|x
