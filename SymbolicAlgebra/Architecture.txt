SymbolicVariable   Class  to express a term

ax^p   where  a:Coeffecient
			  x:Symbol
			  p: power

contains 
	1) Coeffecient Part   	(native double value)
	2) Symbol             	(any valid text)
	3) SymbolPower        	(Power of the symbol )
	4) SymbolPowerTerm    	(SymbolicVariable instance [override the SymbolPower when used])
                         	This is for the usage of raising power to symbols and not native values.
	5) CoeffecientPowerTerm  (SymbolicVariable instance of Coeffecient Part)

	6) FusedSymbols			(for multiplied variables in the same term)
	7) FusedConstants		(for multiplied coeffecients that have symbolic constants)

	8) AddedTerms           (
								SymbolicVariable instances that is added or subtracted from the original term 
								they are included in the same expression
								think of it as linked list
							)

	9) ExtraTerms			( 
								Another terms but do not share the same divisor of the primary pattern
							)


Definitions:
Multi Term:  Symbolic variables that contains plus or minus  other symbolic variables
          i.e.    x+2*y-5*z
